// This class uses an initialized instance of a U8G2 screen and uses it to easily display debug messages on it.
// Adding new "debug lines" will scroll the previous ones when needed.
// The U8G2 object can be configured outside this class (for instance the Font) or you might use
// this class methods to choose the font, size etc.
// It is possible to add a default delay after adding a new line, just to be sure that they can be read.
